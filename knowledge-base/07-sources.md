# Sources and verification

**Specification check: 2026-09-23.** The published [EIP-8297](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8297) and [EIP-8347](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8347) pages were checked for the rules summarized in this knowledge base. Both pages displayed `Draft`; EIP-8347 listed `requires: 7523, 7928, 8159, 8297`. The implementation snapshot below was last swept **2026-09-17** and was not refreshed during the September 23 spec check. A targeted [Hive artifact draft](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/1614) review was added September 23. Dates matter: do not promote a dated branch finding into a current claim.

## Primary sources

| Source | Use it for | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| [EIP-8297](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8297) | Tree nodes, key derivation, values, deletion, and security rationale | Draft; tree hash not final. |
| [EIP-8347](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8347) | Offline migration, canonical files, verification, BAL replay, and swap | Draft; anchor/fork schedule and telemetry wire rules open. |
| [Migration strategy roadmap](https://hackmd.io/@CPerezz/H1Q2zt8NMe) | Program phases and operator planning | Strategy, not normative; may retain older artifact text. |
| [PBT spec rendering](https://cperezz.github.io/pbt-spec/) | Historical rationale | May render superseded key and node designs; see [design evolution](05-design-evolution.md). |
| [Verkle transition survey](https://notes.ethereum.org/@parithosh/verkle-transition) | Historical online/offline options | Predates PBT. |
| [EIP-2926](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2926), [EIP-8038](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8038), [EIP-8037](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8037) | Related code- and state-gas proposals | Not a final PBT gas schedule. |
| [Code-chunk analysis](https://hackmd.io/@jsign/verkle-code-mainnet-chunking-analysis) | Verkle-era empirical code access data | Do not treat its gas estimates as PBT constants. |

EIP-8347's preimage file changed in [PR #12215](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/12215) to fixed-width records sorted by hashed key. The snapshot still uses RLP leaf records. Its [PR #12239](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/12239) added EIP-7523 as a dependency. EIP-8297's current delegation header leaf came through [PR #12114](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/12114).

## Dated implementation evidence

| Source | September 2026 finding | Verification limit |
|---|---|---|
| [PBT devnet](https://github.com/CPerezz/pbt-devnet) | On 2026-09-17, tree-at-genesis ran seven nodes across geth, Besu, Erigon, and Nethermind. A four-client migration profile exercised different migration mechanisms. | The accepted M1 gate used empty state. Client evidence contracts differ; this is not mainnet-scale validation. |
| [geth PBT branch](https://github.com/CPerezz/go-ethereum/tree/pbt) | Converter, snapshot import/dual-check, BAL follower, activation, and transition-window code existed. | At the 2026-09-17 check, its preimage writer still used the old RLP/address-order format. A later Hive draft tested a corrected branch; recheck before calling the branch conformant. |
| [Erigon PBT branch](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/tree/binary-trie) and [tracking issue](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/issues/23389) | Commitment implementation, devnet participation, and conversion work in progress. | Its then-reported zero-leaf and account-removal behavior differed from EIP-8297. |
| [Nethermind PBT PR](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/12573) | Active prototype and devnet participant. | PR retained a prototype/not-for-merge warning. |
| [Besu PBT library](https://github.com/besu-eth/besu-stateless/pull/92) | Tree and migration integration in a devnet branch. | Migration introspection was thinner than other clients in that snapshot. |
| [execution-specs binary-trie PR](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/3207) | EIP-8297 reference implementation and fixtures proposed upstream. | September 17 snapshot still saw no EIP-8347 migration suite on that branch. |
| [Hive artifact PR #1614](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/1614) | September 23 draft with shared artifact mutations and producer checks. | PR-reported results, not re-run here; see [testing inventory](12-testing-inventory.md#artifact-conformance). |

For each implementation, inspect the branch/PR and its commit date before updating a status statement. A devnet pass shows what its workloads and evidence contracts checked, not full spec conformance. BLAKE3 root agreement among clients also does not settle EIP-8297's hash choice.

## Reth targeted review — 2026-10-28

Reviewed [`paradigmxyz/reth-oss@feat/pbt`, commit
`e88254ac38703e617a68d0c1d6a1debd4e80cf81`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-oss/tree/e88254ac38703e617a68d0c1d6a1debd4e80cf81).
This is a targeted source review; it does not refresh the September findings for
the other clients or establish shared-devnet participation.

- [`crates/trie/pbt`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-oss/tree/e88254ac38703e617a68d0c1d6a1debd4e80cf81/crates/trie/pbt)
  implements the tree, state embedding and proofs, with optional execution,
  migration, BAL replay, and persistence modules. Migration uses tagged snapshot
  records, so the older RLP snapshot description elsewhere in this dated knowledge
  base must not be used as the implementation contract.
- [`testdata/README.md`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-oss/blob/e88254ac38703e617a68d0c1d6a1debd4e80cf81/crates/trie/pbt/testdata/README.md)
  pins EELS vectors at `09d2088cf9f338e660cb04f948653baf544b7ba6`.
  These cover tree/state roots and encoding; they are not the full EEST execution
  fixture release or a cross-client test run.
- The engine's `PbtStateRootStrategy` and
  [`examples/pbt-node`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-oss/tree/e88254ac38703e617a68d0c1d6a1debd4e80cf81/examples/pbt-node)
  provide timestamp activation, shadow commitments and payload building while
  retaining MPT updates. The example disables the stock MPT proof RPC.
- The implementation documents in-memory account indexes, full-state checkpoint
  rewrites and unpruned durable checkpoints. PBT-native staged/backfill and snap
  sync, automated anchor/snapshot/BAL retrieval, finalized checkpoint pruning,
  and public PBT proof RPC remain follow-up work. Do not treat this prototype as
  production or mainnet-scale readiness.

## Non-public inputs

A July 27–29, 2026 CL-side discussion covered candidate transports for signed attester shadow roots, including gossip, subnets, request/response, ENR, and consensus-field changes. It was a design conversation, not a specification or decision. [Attester telemetry](11-attester-telemetry-transport.md) summarizes its technical questions without attributing private comments by name. EIP-8347 remains authoritative on what is actually specified.

## How to re-verify

1. Read both published EIP pages and compare their specification sections with [tree structure](02-tree-structure.md), [key derivation](03-key-derivation.md), and [migration](04-migration.md).
2. Check each EIP's source commit history for changed text, especially key layout, zero handling, preimage encoding, and dependencies.
3. Inspect devnet source pins and client PRs at explicit commits. Re-run tests before reporting passes; preserve the source date when reporting a snapshot.
4. Update the [testing inventory](12-testing-inventory.md), [roadmap](../roadmap/README.md), and [open questions](../open-questions.md) if a spec decision or implementation gate actually changes.
