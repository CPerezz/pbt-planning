# PBT migration rehearsal on a Glamsterdam mainnet fork

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | Draft for coordination; revised on 2026-09-30 following the September 28 sync |
| **Network** | Retained ethpandaops Glamsterdam mainnet fork (exact network TBD) |
| **Window** | After Glamsterdam testing and before the fork is decommissioned |
| **Goal** | Prove an end-to-end, multi-client MPT → PBT migration on mainnet-scale state |
| **Specs** | [EIP-8297](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8297), [EIP-8347](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8347), [EIP-7928](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928), [EIP-8159](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8159) |

## Approach

Reuse the fork after Glamsterdam testing. Upgrade execution clients, then schedule two points:

- **`N` — snapshot anchor:** preserve the state at this block and wait for finality before conversion.
- **`S` — PBT activation:** schedule only after all clients have caught up and passed migration checks.

Leave both unset during Glamsterdam testing. One dedicated Erigon node exports the preimages and generates a PBT snapshot from the finalized state at `N`. ethpandaops distributes both artifacts to the remaining nodes. Each receiving node verifies the artifacts against its preserved MPT state at `N`, imports the PBT snapshot, and replays block-level access lists (BALs) from `N + 1` to catch up. Test both trees under load before activating PBT.

The converter that calculates the PBT snapshot at `N` can work offline and be retired once its artifacts are validated and retained. It can also be "beefier" to speed up the process. Receiving nodes should continue processing live MPT blocks during snapshot verification and PBT import. A brief restart to supply artifact paths may be required.

Consensus clients and validator assignments are expected to stay unchanged.

## Roles

| Entity | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **ethpandaops** | Run and size the network, deploy builds/configuration, operate the Erigon generator, distribute preimages and the PBT snapshot, retain BALs, and collect metrics. |
| **State team** | Provide the specs and tests, coordinate `N` and `S`, compare results, and decide whether each step passes. |
| **client teams** | Implement snapshot verification/import, BAL replay, and activation. Provide builds and commands, and measure resource needs. |

## Planning assumptions

- **Storage and transfer:** For the PBT artifacts, we estimate 94.2 GB for the PBT snapshot and 61.0 GB for the preimage file. In addition, after the import, nodes will need an additional 450 GB for the PBT trie data.
- **Hardware:** aim for two node types:
  - 8-core, 16 GB RAM, 2 TB disk
  - 8-core, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB disk
- **BALs:** confirm that the normal 18-day retention covers generation, distribution, verification/import, and catch-up from `N + 1`, with margin for retries. Extend retention or preserve BALs separately if measurements show it is insufficient.
- **Window:** at least 2 weeks of BAL replay and maintaining both trees before activation. Generation, transfer, and import time are additional and still TBD.
- **Clients:** Geth, Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon.

## Implementation status

Every receiving client needs snapshot verification/import, BAL replay, and fork activation. Erigon must additionally provide the converter. All teams should still complete converters for separate benchmarks, even though they will not be exercised in the rehearsal. Their availability does not gate participation as a snapshot consumer.

| Client | Converter | Snapshot consumer | BAL replay | Fork activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Geth** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Nethermind** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Besu** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Erigon** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Testing** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |

The [pbt-devnet](https://github.com/CPerezz/pbt-devnet) already exercises BAL replay alongside activation, restart, and reorgs. Replay coverage exists but needs strengthening. Converter and snapshot consumer tests are implemented in [Hive](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/1614).

### Client branches

Client branches used by [Hive](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/1614):

- **Geth:** [CPerezz/go-ethereum — pbt](https://github.com/CPerezz/go-ethereum/tree/pbt)
- **Nethermind:** [NethermindEth/nethermind — pbt-state](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/tree/pbt-state)
- **Besu:** [matkt/besu — glamsterdam-devnet-8-pbt](https://github.com/matkt/besu/tree/glamsterdam-devnet-8-pbt), with [besu-stateless — feat/partitioned-binary-trie](https://github.com/besu-eth/besu-stateless/tree/feat/partitioned-binary-trie)
- **Erigon:** [erigontech/erigon — binary-trie](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/tree/binary-trie)

### Commands

<details>
<summary><strong>Run the Erigon converter</strong></summary>

On the dedicated source datadir preserved at `N`, export both shared artifacts:

```sh
erigon snapshots export-pbt --datadir=<source-datadir> --chain=<chain> \
  --out=<artifact-dir> --experimental.bin-commitment.hash=blake3
```

This writes `pbt-snapshot.bin`, `framed.bin` (preimages), and metadata. There is no block flag: pin the source at `N` before export and check the recorded block/hash. [More info on export requirements](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/blob/7b675afb/docs/pbt-migration.md#export).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run the snapshot consumer</strong></summary>

**Geth:** stop the node, then verify and import into its datadir. Omit `--verify-only`, which checks the files without importing them. [Source](https://github.com/CPerezz/go-ethereum/blob/fbfd486b/cmd/geth/bintrie_import.go).

```sh
geth --datadir <datadir> bintrie import <snapshot> <preimages> <N>
```

If the PBT namespace already contains state from an earlier import or bootstrap, add `--force` after `bintrie import` to replace it. This is unnecessary for a clean namespace.

**Nethermind:** restart with the artifact paths and anchor. Import runs in the background. [Configuration](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/91ba4d29/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.State.Pbt/IPbtConfig.cs).

```sh
nethermind --config <node-config> \
  --Pbt.Enabled=true --FlatDb.Enabled=true --FlatDb.Layout=Flat \
  --Pbt.MigrationSnapshotPath=<snapshot> --Pbt.MigrationPreimagesPath=<preimages> \
  --Pbt.MigrationAnchor=<N> --Sync.FastSync=false
```

Before re-anchoring, stop the node and clear its native PBT database if it was previously seeded from another anchor.

**Besu:** restart with the artifact paths and the hash of `N`. The migrator verifies and loads the snapshot once the anchor is finalized. [Source](https://github.com/matkt/besu/blob/ba419e5/ethereum/core/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/trie/pathbased/bonsai/migration/eip8347/README.md#importing-a-snapshot-into-a-node).

```sh
besu --data-path=<datadir> --genesis-file=<genesis> \
  --Xpbt-snapshot-file=<snapshot> --Xpbt-preimages-file=<preimages> \
  --Xpbt-snapshot-anchor-block-hash=<hash-of-N>
```

**Erigon:** Hive exercises verification with:

```sh
erigon --datadir <datadir> snapshots verify-pbt \
  --snapshot <snapshot> --preimages <preimages> --block <N> --tmpdir <workdir>
```

Import is documented as **test-only**, on a stopped v3 hex datadir at the matching block end, with matching snapshot metadata:

```sh
integration commitment import-pbt --datadir=<datadir> --chain=<chain> \
  --snapshot=<snapshot> --experimental.bin-commitment.hash=blake3
```

The production consumer procedure is **TBD**; verification alone does not import the state. [Hive shim](https://github.com/CPerezz/hive/blob/1d1a94c0e4a98ea0871d305364b118f9349c376a/simulators/ethereum/pbt-artifacts/shims/erigon.sh), [import requirements](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/blob/7b675afb/docs/pbt-migration.md#import-test-only).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run BAL replay</strong></summary>

- **Geth:** restart with `geth --datadir <datadir> --syncmode=full` plus the normal node options. The [migration follower](https://github.com/CPerezz/go-ethereum/blob/fbfd486b/core/bintrie_follower.go) catches up from the imported anchor using BALs.
- **Nethermind:** keep the consumer command above running. The [BAL follower starts after import](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/91ba4d29/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.State.Pbt/Steps/InitializePbtMigration.cs); no separate replay command.
- **Besu:** keep the consumer command above running. The migrator catches up from the anchor using trie logs where available, otherwise BALs; no separate replay command.
- **Erigon:** snapshot-to-BAL-replay command **TBD**. The [devnet](https://github.com/CPerezz/pbt-devnet/blob/main/args/migration.yaml) uses `COMMITMENT_HEX_BIN=true` from init to maintain both trees; this does not establish replay from an imported snapshot.

</details>

<br>

The commands above use the source tested in the October 5 Hive run and the Hive shims. Notes:

- Replace placeholders with the rehearsal paths and anchor, keeping the node's normal network, Engine API, and peer configuration.
- Migration requires `binaryTrieTime` in the chain configuration, which sets the Unix timestamp for PBT activation (`S`). This should be set to 2 weeks after `N`.

### Remaining preparation

- [X] **client teams:** confirm component status and Glamsterdam compatibility, finish missing consumer/replay/activation work, and provide pinned builds, commands, configuration keys, restart requirements, and resource measurements.
- [X] **State team and client teams:** settle and pin the PBT snapshot format and compression.
- [X] **Carlos / State team:** update the PBT devnet Kurtosis package and Hive fixtures to consume generated preimages and PBT snapshots. Run a small populated-state migration covering representative accounts, storage, and delegations through verification/import → BAL replay → activation across clients.
- [X] **Artem / Erigon:** provide sample preimages and a PBT snapshot for cross-client import testing.
- [ ] **Carlos and client teams:** benchmark conversion separately on mainnet-scale state and share timing/resource results with ethpandaops.
- [ ] **Maria / ethpandaops:** align on `N`, the dedicated converter, artifact hosting and download procedures, and a coordinated consumer restart plan that preserves network finality.

## Run process

Throughout the run, ethpandaops collects Grafana/Prometheus data, client logs, `/proc` metrics, and other available host/hardware telemetry to track:

- **Resource usage:** CPU load, memory pressure, disk space and I/O, and network usage.
- **Time per phase:** generation, upload, download, verification, import, and BAL replay, measured separately.
- **Live network performance:** block-processing latency, head lag, and validator participation, especially during concurrent snapshot verification/import.

| Step | Actions | Ready to continue when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Prepare** | Client teams supply qualified builds. ethpandaops confirms storage and upgrades execution nodes after Glamsterdam testing. | The network finalizes normally after the upgrade. |
| **2. Capture `N`** | State team picks the anchor. ethpandaops preserves the Erigon source state and each consumer's MPT state needed to verify at `N`, and retains BALs from `N + 1`. | `N` is finalized; its hash and MPT root are recorded; generator and consumer anchor-state access is verified. |
| **3. Generate and distribute** | On the dedicated Erigon node, export preimages and generate one PBT snapshot at `N`. Distribute both artifacts across all devnet nodes. | The matching artifact pair is available to all nodes. |
| **4. Verify and import** | Each client verifies the shared artifacts against its MPT state at `N` and constructs its local PBT database while continuing live block processing. | Every node passes verification and imports the same PBT root at `N`. Network finality and live block processing remain healthy within agreed limits. |
| **5. BAL replay** | Nodes run BAL replay from `N + 1` while running normal block processing. PBT roots are recorded. | All clients reach the live head and agree on PBT roots at matching blocks. |
| **6. Activate `S`** | State team coordinates a future `S`. ethpandaops applies the configuration. | The network finalizes after `S` with all clients agreeing on head and PBT root. |
| **7. Capture client databases** | ethpandaops takes a snapshot of each client's native PBT database for later benchmarking. These are the client-specific database backups, distinct from the shared PBT snapshot used for migration. | A database backup for every client is retained. |

For Glamsterdam testing, ethpandaops plans to deploy the state needed for stateful benchmarks. The client-specific PBT database backups from step 7 should therefore be sufficient to run the same benchmarks on PBT and compare with MPT, without the need for custom spammers during step 5.
